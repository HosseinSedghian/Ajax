# AJAX JSON Table Project

This project demonstrates how to use **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to fetch data from a public API using **AJAX** and display the JSON response in a clean, styled table.

## 🚀 Features
- Fetches data from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) using AJAX.
- Dynamically generates a table to display the JSON response.
- Simple and responsive design with custom CSS styling.
- Lightweight and beginner-friendly project to understand AJAX and DOM manipulation.

## 📂 Project Structure
```
├── index.html        # Main HTML file
├── style.css         # CSS for styling the table
├── script.js         # JavaScript with AJAX request and DOM handling
```

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The `script.js` file sends an AJAX request to:
   ```
   https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
   ```
2. The JSON response (list of posts) is parsed.
3. Each post is displayed in a table with columns such as:
   - **ID**
   - **Title**
   - **Body**

## 🖥️ Demo
You can view the project live by opening `index.html` in your browser or visiting the published GitHub Pages link (if enabled).
